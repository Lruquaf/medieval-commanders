# üé® Styling Updates Summary

## ‚úÖ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Admin Card Detail Modal** 
- **Issue**: Modal appeared as very long, narrow window
- **Solution**: Increased max-width from 600px to 700px and width to 90%
- **Result**: Modal now matches collection page modal proportions

### 2. **Reduced Modal Image Size**
- **Issue**: Image area was too large in detail modal
- **Solution**: Reduced max-width/height from 500px to 350px
- **Result**: More appropriate image size while maintaining square ratio

### 3. **Moved Edit/Delete Buttons to Top**
- **Issue**: Buttons were positioned below tier indicator
- **Solution**: Moved buttons to top-right corner (top: 10px, right: 10px)
- **Result**: Better visual hierarchy, hover functionality retained

### 4. **Consistent Card Sizing Across App**
- **Issue**: Collection grid cards different from admin cards
- **Solution**: Applied same square styling (200px, aspect-ratio: 1) to all card grids
- **Result**: Consistent 200x200px square images across entire application
